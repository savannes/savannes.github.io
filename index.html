  I’m an ESL teacher, teaching from beginners to advanced students since 2018.<br>
  I’ve helped over 40 students with different backgrounds to achieve their purposes in the English Language.<br>
  I’m passionate about the English Language and I consider myself to be an eager student, always looking forward a next certification.<br>
  I’m currently under study in English Language Teaching Post graduation, I have a TEFL/TESOL Professional Certificate with an Endorsement in English Grammar and I’m also graduated in International Relations and have an MBA on Project Management.<br> 
  I’ve worked for almost 10 years in the Oil and Gas industry, which helped me have a good Business English experience such as writing e-mails, contact with clients, reading contracts and translations of documents.
