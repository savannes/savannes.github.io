      <p id="msg">I’m an ESL teacher, teaching from beginners to advanced students since 2018. I’ve helped over 40 students with different backgrounds to achieve their purposes in the English Language. 
      I’m passionate about the English Language and I consider myself to be an eager student, always looking forward a next certification. 
      I’m currently under study in English Language Teaching Post graduation, I have a TEFL/TESOL Professional Certificate with an Endorsement in English Grammar and I’m also graduated in International Relations and have an MBA on Project Management. 
      I’ve worked for almost 10 years in the Oil and Gas industry, which helped me have a good Business English experience such as writing e-mails, contact with clients, reading contracts and translations of documents.
